##READ ME FILE

These scripts allow you to predict antifungal function from sOTU data from amplicon sequencing.  The output includes your Metadata table with additional columns of information including 
   (1) total reads associated with antifungal function,  
   (2) proportional reads associated  with antifungal function, and 
   (3) richness of antifungal OTUs.


Note: Before the first time you use the script you will probably have to make it executable as follows:

chmod u+x path/to/scriptfile/Antifungal_Predictions_conda.sh 



To run the script:


bash path/2/Antifungal_Predictions_conda.sh(drag and drop script file)

You will be prompted with questions to drag in other files, including the R script file (Antifungal_Rcomputations_Base.r)
